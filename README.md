# Stellar
**Not working on this repo anymore as [the name Stellar was already taken for a cryptocurrency](https://www.stellar.org/). Instead check out [DatPart](https://github.com/hughisaacs2/DatPart).**

~~Proof of concept WebTorrent and WebRTC Dat site viewer for Chrome OS (currently only works with WebTorrent sites).~~

~~This loads the same sites as [PeerCloud](https://github.com/jhiesey/peercloud).~~

~~Sites can be loaded via the .torrent_site and .dat_site. top-level domains.~~

~~For example you can load the PeerCloud demo site at http://bbe89c886ba65df3ef5f0c267e3267e74d0074c9.torrent_site/ or in the future the Acrylic Style Dat site (when I get Dat support working) at http://bbe89c886ba65df3ef5f0c267e3267e74d0074c9.dat_site/~~

~~Oh also, Chrome's Omnibar treats all non-standard TLDs as searches, so you'll have to type the inital HTTP:// or put a slash at the end of the URL for it to load the site.~~
